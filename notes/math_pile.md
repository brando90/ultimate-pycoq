# Math Pile

Feel free to math a pull request and add a link to your mathematics data set. 
Ideally we are collecting doing reasoning (think of proofs) -- not just arithmetic. 

## List of potential datasets
- Math-LM (~Open Minerva): Repository for the Math-LM project, an open-source replication of the Minerva model. This repository hosts data and model training code: https://github.com/brando90/math-lm
- coqgym via proberbo9001: run this to build coq-gym https://github.com/brando90/proverbot9001/blob/develop/main_pycoq_build_dataset.sh
- upycoq's data set: it's suppose to be an improvement over the coqgym dataset (e.g. deps installs work): run this to build it https://github.com/brando90/ultimate-pycoq/blob/main/main_pycoq_build_dataset.sh (same as prev)
